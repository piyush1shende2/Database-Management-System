Types of Keys in Relational Model

1. Candidate Key
2. Primary Key
3. Super Key
4. Alternate Key
5. Foreign Key
6. Composite Key


Candidate Key:-
This is the minimum key.
It is a super key that contains no duplicate data, called the adversary's key.
The smallest set of criteria that can be used to describe specific data.
It must have certain values. It can have NULL values.
Every table must have at least one candidate key.
A table can have many candidate keys but only one key.
Candidate key values ​​are unique and can be null for tuples.
There will be many important rivals in the relationship.

Primary Key:-
A primary key in DBMS is uniquely identifying each record or row within a table.
This is a private key.
It only recognizes one tuple (one file) at a time.
It has no equal, it is unique. It cannot be NULL.
The primary key does not have to be a single column; many rows can act as primary keys of the table.

Super Key:-
The set of properties that uniquely identify a tuple is called a super key.
Adding zero or more characters to the candidate key creates a superkey.
The candidate key is the super key but has not been modified.
Super Key values ​​can also be NULL.

Alternate Key:- 
Keys that are not primary keys are called secondary keys.
Any key other than the primary key is called an alternate key.
This is a modified key.
Contains two or more fields to describe two or more documents.

Foreign Key:- 
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables.
It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.
If an attribute can only be derived from values ​​that occur in other attributes, then it will be a foreign key to the attribute it references.
The relationship is called a relationship and the corresponding behavior is called a reference behavior.
The use of social behavior should be a priority. or multiple relationships (tables).
